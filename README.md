# Text Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on text data, identifying if the sentiment expressed is positive, negative, or neutral. This application uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify text and provides insights into the emotions conveyed in the input.

## Features
- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies text as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Score Analysis**: Provides a sentiment score (if applicable) to indicate intensity.
- **Data Processing**: Cleans and processes text data to improve accuracy.
- **Batch Processing**: Allows analyzing multiple text entries at once.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.8+**
- Required packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  Common packages include:
  - `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit)
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
